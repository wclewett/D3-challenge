          <h2 class="articleHeading">Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Obesity</strong><br>
             - As it related to poverty, we can see there is a slightly positive correlation between states' obesity rates and the percentange 
            of the states' population living in poverty. <br>
             - Age and Obesity do not appear to have a meaningful correlation at the state level. <br>
             - One of the stronger correlations in the entire set, Obesity and Median Household Income have a clearly visible negative correlation. In better terms, 
            obesity rates are lower in states with a higher Median Household Income.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Smoking</strong><br>
             - Another one of our stronger correlations, Smoking and Poverty have a slightly visible positive correlation. <br>
             - When it comes to Smoking and Age, it appears that most states fall within a ten year age range for their median smoker's age. Only 4 of the datapoints in the 
            entire dataset fall outside of ages 32 to 42. <br>
             - Similar to Obesity and Median Household Income, we see a strong negative correlation between the percentange of smokers and the Median Household Income.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Healthcare</strong><br>
             - Similar to Obesity and Smoking, we seea strong positive correlation between the percentange of residents lacking healthcare and the percentange of residents 
            in poverty. <br>
             - Again, the Age group seems to show no reasonable correlation, and most datapoints fall between 32 and 42. <br>
             - The weakest of the three groups, Median Household Income and percentange of residents lacking healthcare still show a visible negative correlation.</p>
